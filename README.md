# Intravenous 2 - d1s_guns Mod

## Overview
This mod adds new weapons and attachments to Intravenous 2 using existing game content as a base.

The project serves as a foundation for those interested in basic modding of Intravenous 2 guns and attachments.

You are free to edit and reuse the code included in this project for your own purposes.

## Notes
This mod's content is what I would consider "low effort," as no custom graphics are provided by me for the new weapons and attachments. As such, I've decided against publishing this on the Steam Workshop for the time being.
Nonetheless, included are the .41 AE caliber conversion for the Mini-UZI and the .50 BMG caliber conversion for the R700 (both mods Iâ€™ve published on the Workshop).

The balance of the guns and attachments is not guaranteed, so feel free to tweak them to your own liking if you use them in gameplay.

### On data inheritance

Most stats of the guns contained in this project are inherited from other base game guns; as such, many properties won't be declared in the included files. Sprites and animations are inherited in the same manner.

**IMPORTANT**: Weapons can inherit the attachments table (e.g., the G36C inherits the AR-15 `selectableMods` table) from other weapons or use shared tables (many pistols use the same `weapons.genericPistolMods` table, and my P226 does as well). As a side effect, any override of the `selectableMods` table will be replicated across every other weapon using the same table (whether inherited or shared) due to reference assignment to the table.

### Properties

Please check the P226 file for detailed documentation of the basic properties of weapons.

#### Property override

Various properties are overridden within the internal `weapons:register()` method, which is usually called at the end of the weapon configuration to add the weapon to the game registry. If you don't declare these properties, they will simply inherit the same values as the properties of the weapon you are inheriting from, with a couple of important exceptions: `bulletSpeed` and `spreadPerShot`.
Due to the internal logic of the method, these two properties will always be overridden and should therefore be explicitly declared, with a raw value assigned before calling the method. Alternatively, they can be overridden after the method has been called by assigning the final values from other weapons (both examples are provided in the weapon files).

Following is a list of notable properties overridden within `weapons:register()` and how they are modified. If you wish to tweak these values, be sure to assign raw values before calling the method or to override them with the final values from other weapons after the method has been called.

- `noiseRadius` -> `noiseRadius * 1.25`
- `spreadPerShot` -> `spreadPerShot * 1.5`
- `bulletSpeed` -> `bulletSpeed * FPS_TO_MS` (`FPS_TO_MS` = `2.296588` | as such the raw value of bulletSpeed is in ft/s) (property modified inside `adjustMuzzleVelocity()`)

#### Attachments valueMods and weapons modOverrides
The `valueMods` table property of attachments contains the various properties that the attachment modifies. Meanwhile the `modOverrides` table property of weapons contains adjustments for the property modifiers of any attachment.

Due to how `modOverrides` works in the code, only overrides of modifiers already existing in the original valueMods will take effect. As an example, in the base game, `10mm_magazine` doesn't have `magSize`in its `valueMods`: as a side effect if you try to use `modOverrides` to override the magazine size of a weapon when using the 10MM Caliber Conversion it won't work (included in this mod is a patch that adds `magSize` to the `valueMods` table of `10mm_magazine`).
